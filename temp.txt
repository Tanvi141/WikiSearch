'''anarchism''' is a [[political philosophy]] and [[political movement|movement]] that rejects all involuntary, coercive forms of [[hierarchy]]. it calls for the abolition of the [[state (polity)|state]] which it holds to be undesirable, unnecessary, and harmful.

the [[history of anarchism]] goes back to [[prehistory]], when some humans lived in anarchistic societies long before the establishment of formal states, [[realm]]s or [[empire]]s. with the rise of organised hierarchical bodies, [[skepticism]] toward authority also rose, but it was not until the 19th century that a self-conscious political movement emerged. during the latter half of the 19th and the first decades of the 20th century, the anarchist movement flourished in most parts of the world and had a significant role in workers' struggles for [[emancipation]]. various [[anarchist schools of thought]] formed during this period. anarchists have taken part in several revolutions, most notably in the [[spanish civil war]], whose end marked the end of [[classical era of anarchism|anarchism's classical era]]. in the last decades of the 20th century and into the 21st century, the anarchist movement has been resurgent once more.

anarchism employs various tactics in order to meet its ideal ends; these can be broadly separated into revolutionary and evolutionary tactics. there is significant overlap between the two which are merely descriptive. revolutionary tactics aim to bring down authority and state, and have taken a violent turn in the past. evolutionary tactics aim to prefigure what an anarchist society would be like. anarchist thought, criticism and [[praxis (process)|praxis]] have played a part in diverse areas of human society. criticism of anarchism mainly focuses on claims of it being internally inconsistent, violent and utopian.

== etymology, terminology and definition ==
{{main|definition of anarchism and libertarianism}}
{{see also|glossary of anarchism}}
the etymological origin of ''anarchism'' is from the ancient greek ''anarkhia'', meaning "without a ruler", composed of the prefix ''an-'' (i.e. "without") and the word ''arkhos'' (i.e. "leader" or "ruler"). the suffix ''[[-ism]]'' denotes the ideological current that favours [[anarchy]].{{sfnm|1a1=bates|1y=2017|1p=128|2a1=long|2y=2013|2p=217}} ''anarchism'' appears in english from 1642{{sfn|merriam-webster|2019|loc="anarchism"}} as ''anarchisme'' and ''anarchy'' from 1539.{{sfn|oxford english dictionary|2005|loc="anarchism"}} various factions within the [[french revolution]] labelled their opponents as ''anarchists'', although few such accused shared many views with later anarchists. many revolutionaries of the 19th century such as [[william godwin]] (1756–1836) and [[wilhelm weitling]] (1808–1871) would contribute to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation, but they did not use ''anarchist'' or ''anarchism'' in describing themselves or their beliefs.{{sfn|joll|1964|pp=27–37}}

the first political philosopher to call himself an ''anarchist'' ({{lang-fr|anarchiste}}) was [[pierre-joseph proudhon]] (1809–1865), marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-19th century. since the 1890s and beginning in france,{{sfn|nettlau|1996|p=162}} ''[[libertarianism]]'' has often been used as a synonym for anarchism{{sfn|guerin|1970|loc="the basic ideas of anarchism"}} and its use as a synonym is still common outside the united states.{{sfnm|1a1=ward|1y=2004|1p=62|2a1=goodway|2y=2006|2p=4|3a1=skirda|3y=2002|3p=183|4a1=fernández|4y=2009|4p=9}} on the other hand, some use ''libertarianism'' to refer to [[individualist anarchism|individualistic free-market philosophy]] only, referring to [[free-market anarchism]] as ''libertarian anarchism''.{{sfn|morris|2002|p=61}}

while [[opposition to the state]] is central to anarchist thought, defining anarchism is not an easy task as there is a lot of discussion among scholars and anarchists on the matter and various currents perceive anarchism slightly differently.{{sfn|long|2013|p=217}} hence, it might be true to say that anarchism is a cluster of political philosophies opposing [[authority]] and [[hierarchical organization]] (including the [[state (polity)|state]], [[anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]], [[anarchism and nationalism|nationalism]] and all associated [[institution]]s) in the conduct of all [[human relations]] in favour of a society based on [[voluntary association]], on [[freedom]] and on [[decentralisation]], but this definition has the same shortcomings as the definition based on etymology (which is simply a negation of a ruler), or based on anti-statism (anarchism is much more than that) or even the anti-authoritarian (which is an ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a posteriori]]'' conclusion).{{sfnm|1a1=mclaughlin|1y=2007|1pp=25–29|2a1=long|2y=2013|2pp=217}} nonetheless, major elements of the definition of anarchism include the following:{{sfn|mclaughlin|2007|pp=25–26}}
# the will for a non-coercive society.
# the rejection of the state apparatus.
# the belief that human nature allows humans to exist in or progress toward such a non-coercive society.
# a suggestion on how to act to pursue the ideal of anarchy.

=== pre-modern era ===
[[file:paolo monti - servizio fotografico (napoli, 1969) - beic 6353768.jpg|thumb|upright=.7|[[zeno of citium]] (c. 334 – c. 262 bc), whose ''[[republic (zeno)|republic]]'' inspired [[peter kropotkin]]{{sfn|marshall|1993|p=70}}]]
during the prehistoric era of mankind, an established authority did not exist.{{clarification needed|date=july 2020}} it was after the creation of towns and cities that institutions of authority were established and anarchistic ideas espoused as a reaction.{{sfn|graham|2005|pp=xi–xiv}} most notable precursors to anarchism in the ancient world were in [[history of china|china]] and [[ancient greece|greece]]. in china, [[philosophical anarchism]] (i.e. the discussion on the legitimacy of the state) was delineated by [[taoism|taoist philosophers]] [[zhuang zhou]] and [[laozi]].{{sfnm|1a1=coutinho|1y=2016|2a1=marshall|2y=1993|2p=54}}

likewise, anarchic attitudes were articulated by tragedians and philosophers in greece. [[aeschylus]] and [[sophocles]] used the myth of [[antigone]] to illustrate the conflict between rules set by the state and [[autonomy|personal autonomy]]. [[socrates]] questioned athenian authorities constantly and insisted to the right of individual freedom of consciousness. [[cynicism (philosophy)|cynics]] dismissed human law (''[[nomos (sociology)|nomos]]'') and associated authorities while trying to live according to nature (''[[physis]]''). [[stoics]] were supportive of a society based on unofficial and friendly relations among its citizens without the presence of a state.{{sfn|marshall|1993|pp=4, 66–73}}

during the [[middle ages]], there was no anarchistic activity except some ascetic religious movements in the [[muslim world]] or in christian europe. this kind of tradition later gave birth to [[anarchism and religion#religious anarchism and anarchist themes in religions|religious anarchism]]. in the [[sasanian empire]], [[mazdak]] called for an [[egalitarianism|egalitarian society]] and the [[abolition of monarchy]], only to be soon executed by emperor [[kavad i]].{{sfn|marshall|1993|p=86}}

in [[basra]], religious sects preached against the state. in europe, various sects developed anti-state and libertarian tendencies. libertarian ideas further emerged during the [[renaissance]] with the spread of [[rationalism|reasoning]] and [[humanism]] through europe. novelists fictionalised ideal societies that were based not on coercion but voluntarism. the [[age of enlightenment|enlightenment]] further pushed towards anarchism with the optimism for social progress.{{sfn|adams|2014|pp=33–63}}

=== modern era ===
during the [[french revolution]], partisan groups such as the [[enragés]] and the {{lang|fr|[[sans-culottes]]}} saw a turning point in the fermentation of anti-state and federalist sentiments.{{sfn|marshall|1993|p=4}} the first anarchist currents developed throughout the 18th century—[[william godwin]] espoused [[philosophical anarchism]] in england, morally delegitimizing the state, [[max stirner]]'s thinking paved the way to individualism, and [[pierre-joseph proudhon]]'s theory of [[mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] found fertile soil in france.{{sfn|marshall|1993|pp=4–5}} this era of classical anarchism lasted until the end of the [[spanish civil war|spanish civil war of 1936]] and is considered the golden age of anarchism.{{sfn|marshall|1993|pp=4–5}}

[[file:bakunin.png|thumb|upright|anarchist [[mikhail bakunin]] opposed the [[marxism|marxist]] aim of [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] and allied himself with the federalists in the [[international workingmen's association|first international]] before his expulsion by the marxists]]
drawing from mutualism, [[mikhail bakunin]] founded [[collectivist anarchism]] and entered the [[international workingmen's association]], a class worker union later known as the first international that formed in 1864 to unite diverse revolutionary currents. the international became a significant political force, with [[karl marx]] being a leading figure and a member of its general council. bakunin's faction (the [[jura federation]]) and proudhon's followers (the [[mutualism (economic theory)|mutualists]]) opposed marxist [[state socialism]], advocating political [[abstentionism]] and small property holdings.{{sfnm|1a1=dodson|1y=2002|1p=312|2a1=thomas|2y=1985|2p=187|3a1=chaliand|3a2=blin|3y=2007|3p=116}} after bitter disputes, the bakuninists were expelled from the international by the marxists at the [[1872 hague congress]].{{sfnm|1a1=graham|1y=2019|1pp=334–336|2a1=marshall|2y=1993|2p=24}} bakunin famously predicted that if revolutionaries gained power by marx's terms, they would end up the new tyrants of workers. after being expelled, anarchists formed the [[anarchist st. imier international|st. imier international]]. under the influence of [[peter kropotkin]], a russian philosopher and scientist, [[anarcho-communism]] overlapped with collectivism.{{sfn|marshall|1993|p=5}} anarcho-communists, who drew inspiration from the 1871 [[paris commune]], advocated for free federation and for the distribution of goods according to one's needs.{{sfn|graham|2005|p=xii}}

at the turn of the century, anarchism had spread all over the world.{{sfn|moya|2015|p=327}} in china, small groups of students imported the humanistic pro-science version of anarcho-communism.{{sfn|marshall|1993|pp=519–521}} tokyo was a hotspot for rebellious youth from countries of the far east, travelling to the japanese capital to study.{{sfnm|1a1=dirlik|1y=1991|1p=133|2a1=ramnath|2y=2019|2pp=681–682}} in [[latin america]], [[anarchism in argentina|argentina]] was a stronghold for [[anarcho-syndicalism]], where it became the most prominent left-wing ideology.{{sfnm|1a1=levy|1y=2011|1p=23|2a1=laursen|2y=2019|2p=157|3a1=marshall|3y=1993|3pp=504–508}} during this time, a minority of anarchists adopted tactics of revolutionary [[political violence]]. this strategy became known as [[propaganda of the deed]].{{sfn|marshall|1993|pp=633–636}} the dismemberment of the french socialist movement into many groups, and the execution and exile of many [[communards]] to penal colonies following the suppression of the paris commune, favoured individualist political expression and acts.{{sfn|anderson|2004}} even though many anarchists distanced themselves from these terrorist acts, infamy came upon the movement.{{sfn|marshall|1993|pp=633–636}} [[illegalism]] was another strategy which some anarchists adopted during this period.{{sfn|bantman|2019|p=374}}

[[file:makhno group.jpg|thumb|left|[[nestor makhno]] with members of the anarchist [[revolutionary insurrectionary army of ukraine]]]]
anarchists enthusiastically participated in the [[russian revolution]]—despite concerns—in opposition to the [[white movement|whites]]. however, they met harsh suppression after the [[bolshevik government]] was stabilized. several anarchists from petrograd and moscow fled to ukraine,{{sfn|avrich|2006|p=204}} notably leading to the [[kronstadt rebellion]] and [[nestor makhno]]'s struggle in the [[free territory]]. with the anarchists being crushed in russia, two new antithetical currents emerged, namely [[platformism]] and [[synthesis anarchism]]. the former sought to create a coherent group that would push for revolution while the latter were against anything that would resemble a political party. seeing the victories of the bolsheviks in the [[october revolution]] and the resulting [[russian civil war]], many workers and activists turned to [[communist party|communist parties]], which grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. in france and the united states, members of major syndicalist movements, the [[general confederation of labour (france)|general confederation of labour]] and [[industrial workers of the world]], left their organisations and joined the [[communist international]].{{sfn|nomad|1966|p=88}}

in the [[spanish civil war]], anarchists and syndicalists ([[confederación nacional del trabajo|cnt]] and [[federación anarquista ibérica|fai]]) once again allied themselves with various currents of leftists. a long tradition of [[spanish anarchism]] led to anarchists playing a pivotal role in the war. in response to the army rebellion, an anarchist-inspired movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of [[barcelona]] and of large areas of rural spain, where they [[collective farming|collectivised]] the land.{{sfn|bolloten|1984|p=1107}} the [[soviet union]] provided some limited assistance at the beginning of the war, but the result was a bitter fight among communists and anarchists at a series of events named [[may days]] as [[joseph stalin]] tried to seize control of the [[republican faction (spanish civil war)|republicans]].{{sfn|marshall|1993|pp=xi, 466}}

=== post-war era ===
[[file:rojava sewing cooperative.jpg|thumb|[[rojava]] supports efforts for workers to form cooperatives, such as this sewing cooperative]]
at the end of [[world war ii]], the anarchist movement was severely weakened.{{sfn|marshall|1993|p=xi}} however, the 1960s witnessed a revival of anarchism likely caused by a perceived failure of [[marxism–leninism]] and tensions built by the [[cold war]].{{sfn|marshall|1993|p=539}} during this time, anarchism took root in other movements critical towards both the state and capitalism, such as the [[anti-nuclear movement|anti-nuclear]], [[environmental movement|environmental]] and [[peace movement|pacifist movements]], the [[new left]], and the [[counterculture of the 1960s]].{{sfn|marshall|1993|pp=xi, 539}} anarchism became associated with [[punk subculture]], as exemplified by bands such as [[crass]] and the [[sex pistols]],{{sfn|marshall|1993|pp=493–494}} and the established [[feminist]] tendencies of [[anarcha-feminism]] returned with vigour during the [[second wave of feminism]].{{sfn|marshall|1993|pp=556–557}}

around the turn of the 21st century, anarchism grew in popularity and influence within [[anti-war]], [[anti-capitalist]], and [[anti-globalisation movement]]s.{{sfn|rupert|2006|p=66}} anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the [[world trade organization]], the [[group of eight]] and the [[world economic forum]]. during the protests, ''[[ad hoc]]'' leaderless anonymous cadres known as [[black bloc]]s engaged in [[riot]]ing, [[property destruction]], and violent confrontations with the [[police]]. other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include [[security culture]], [[affinity group]]s, and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet. a significant event of this period was the confrontations at the [[1999 seattle wto protests|wto conference in seattle in 1999]].{{sfn|rupert|2006|p=66}} anarchist ideas have been influential in the development of the [[zapatista army of national liberation|zapatistas]] in mexico and the democratic federation of northern syria, more commonly known as [[rojava]], a ''[[de facto]]'' [[permanent autonomous zone|autonomous region]] in northern [[syria]].{{sfn|ramnath|2019|p=691}}

== thought ==
{{main|anarchist schools of thought}}
[[anarchist schools of thought]] have been generally grouped into two main historical traditions, [[social anarchism]] and [[individualist anarchism]], owing to their different origins, values and evolution.{{sfnm|1a1=mclean|1a2=mcmillan|1y=2003|1loc="anarchism"|2a1=ostergaard|2y=2003|2p=14|2loc="anarchism"}} the individualist current emphasises [[negative liberty]] in opposing restraints upon the free individual, while the social current emphasises [[positive liberty]] in aiming to achieve the free potential of society through equality and [[social ownership]].{{sfn|harrison|boyd|2003|p=251}} in a chronological sense, anarchism can be segmented by the classical currents of the late 19th century, and the post-classical currents (such as [[anarcha-feminism]], [[green anarchism]] and [[post-anarchism]]) developed thereafter.{{sfn|levy|adams|2019|p=9}}

beyond the specific factions of anarchist movements which constitute political anarchism lies [[philosophical anarchism]], which holds that the state lacks [[morality|moral legitimacy]], without necessarily accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it.{{sfn|egoumenides|2014|p=2}} a component especially of individualist anarchism,{{sfnm|1a1=ostergaard|1y=2006|1p=12|2a1=gabardi|2y=1986|2pp=300–302}} philosophical anarchism may tolerate the existence of a [[minimal state]], but argues that citizens have no [[moral obligation]] to obey government when it conflicts with individual autonomy.{{sfn|klosko|2005|p=4}} anarchism pays significant attention to moral arguments since [[ethics]] have a central role in anarchist philosophy.{{sfn|franks|2019|p=549}}

one reaction against [[sectarianism]] within the anarchist milieu was [[anarchism without adjectives]], a call for [[toleration]] and unity among anarchists first adopted by [[fernando tarrida del mármol]] in 1889 in response to the bitter debates of anarchist theory at the time.{{sfn|avrich|1996|p=6}} despite separation, the various anarchist schools of thought are not seen as distinct entities, but as tendencies that intermingle.{{sfn|marshall|1993|pp=1–6}}

anarchism is usually placed on the [[far-left]] of the [[political spectrum]].{{sfnm|1a1=brooks|1y=1994|1p=xi|2a1=kahn|2y=2000|3a1=moynihan|3y=2007}} much of its [[anarchist economics|economics]] and [[anarchist law|legal philosophy]] reflect [[anti-authoritarian]], [[anti-statist]], and [[libertarian]] interpretations of the [[political radicalism|radical]] [[left-wing]] and [[socialist]] politics{{sfn|guerin|1970|p=12|ps=: "[a]narchism is really a synonym for socialism. the anarchist is primarily a socialist whose aim is to abolish the exploitation of man by man. anarchism is only one of the streams of socialist thought, that stream whose main components are concern for liberty and haste to abolish the state."}} of [[collectivist anarchism|collectivism]], [[anarcho-communism|communism]], [[individualist anarchism|individualism]], [[mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]], and [[anarcho-syndicalism|syndicalism]], among other [[libertarian socialist]] economic theories.{{sfn|guerin|1970|p=35|loc="critique of authoritarian socialism"|ps=: "the anarchists were unanimous in subjecting authoritarian socialism to a barrage of severe criticism. at the time when they made violent and satirical attacks these were not entirely well founded, for those to whom they were addressed were either primitive or "vulgar" communists, whose thought had not yet been fertilized by marxist humanism, or else, in the case of marx and engels themselves, were not as set on authority and state control as the anarchists made out."}} as anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular worldview,{{sfn|marshall|1993|pp=14–17}} many [[history of anarchism|anarchist types and traditions]] exist, and varieties of anarchy diverge widely.{{sfn|sylvan|2007|p=262}}

=== classical ===
[[file:portrait of pierre joseph proudhon 1865.jpg|thumb|upright|[[pierre-joseph proudhon]], the primary proponent of [[mutualism (economic theory)|anarcho-mutualism]], who influenced many future [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchist]] and [[social anarchism|social anarchist]] thinkers{{sfn|wilbur|2019|p=216-218}}]]
inceptive currents among classical anarchist currents were [[mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] and [[individualist anarchism|individualism]]. they were followed by the major currents of social anarchism ([[collectivist anarchism|collectivist]], [[anarcho-communism|communist]], and [[anarcho-syndicalism|syndicalist]]). they differ on organizational and economic aspects of their ideal society.{{sfn|levy|adams|2019|p=2}}

[[mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] is an 18th-century economic theory that was developed into anarchist theory by [[pierre-joseph proudhon]]. its aims include [[reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]], [[free association (marxism and anarchism)|free association]], voluntary [[contract]], [[federation]], and [[monetary reform|credit and currency reform]] that would be regulated by a bank of the people.{{sfn|wilbur|2019|pp=213–218}} mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism.{{sfnm|1a1=avrich|1y=1996|1p=6|2a1=miller|2y=1991|2p=11}} proudhon first characterised his goal as a "third form of society, the synthesis of communism and property".{{sfn|pierson|2013|p=187|ps=. the quote is from proudhon's ''[[what is property?]]'' (1840).}}

[[collectivist anarchism]], also known as anarchist collectivism or anarcho-collectivism,{{sfn|morris|1993|p=76}} is a [[revolutionary socialist]] form of anarchism commonly associated with [[mikhail bakunin]].{{sfn|shannon|2019|p=101}} collectivist anarchists advocate [[collective ownership]] of the means of production, theorised to be achieved through violent revolution,{{sfn|avrich|1996|pp=3–4}} and that workers be paid according to time worked, rather than goods being distributed according to need as in communism. collectivist anarchism arose alongside [[marxism]], but rejected the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] despite the stated marxist goal of a collectivist [[stateless society]].{{sfnm|1a1=heywood|1y=2017|1pp=146–147|2a1=bakunin|2y=1990|2ps=: "they [the marxists] maintain that only a dictatorship—their dictatorship, of course—can create the will of the people, while our answer to this is: no dictatorship can have any other aim but that of self-perpetuation, and it can beget only slavery in the people tolerating it; freedom can be created only by freedom, that is, by a universal rebellion on the part of the people and free organization of the toiling masses from the bottom up."}} [[anarcho-communism]], also known as anarchist-communism, communist anarchism, and libertarian communism, is a theory of anarchism that advocates a [[communist society]] with [[common ownership]] of the means of production,{{sfn|mayne|1999|p=131}} [[direct democracy]], and a [[horizontalidad|horizontal network]] of [[voluntary association]]s and [[workers' council]]s with production and consumption based on the guiding principle: "[[from each according to his ability, to each according to his need]]".{{sfnm|1a1=marshall|1y=1993|1p=327|2a1=turcato|2y=2019|2pp=237–323}} anarcho-communism developed from radical socialist currents after the [[french revolution]],{{sfn|graham|2005}} but it was first formulated as such in the italian section of the [[first international]].{{sfn|pernicone|2009|pp=111–113}} it was later expanded upon in the theoretical work of [[peter kropotkin]].{{sfn|turcato|2019|pp=239–244}}

[[anarcho-syndicalism]], also referred to as revolutionary syndicalism, is a branch of anarchism that views [[labour syndicate]]s as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self-managed by workers. the basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are workers' [[solidarity]], [[direct action]], and [[workers' self-management]].{{sfn|van der walt|2019|p=249}}

[[individualist anarchism]] refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasise the [[individual]] and their [[will (philosophy)|will]] over any kinds of external determinants.{{sfn|ryley|2019|p=225}}  early influences on individualist forms of anarchism include [[william godwin]], [[max stirner]] and [[henry david thoreau]]. through many countries, individualist anarchism attracted a small yet diverse following of bohemian artists and intellectuals{{sfn|marshall|1993|p=440}} as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as [[illegalism]] and [[individual reclamation]].{{sfnm|1a1=imrie|1y=1994|2a1=parry|2y=1987|2p=15}}

anarchist principles undergird contemporary radical social movements of the left. interest in the anarchist movement developed alongside momentum in the [[anti-globalization movement]],{{sfn|evren|2011|p=1}} whose leading activist networks were anarchist in orientation.{{sfn|evren|2011|p=2}} as the movement shaped 21st century radicalism, wider embrace of anarchist principles signaled a revival of interest.{{sfn|evren|2011|p=2}} contemporary news coverage which emphasizes [[black bloc]] demonstrations has reinforced anarchism's historical association with chaos and violence, although its publicity has also led more scholars to engage with the anarchist movement.{{sfn|evren|2011|p=1}} anarchism has continued to generate many philosophies and movements—at times eclectic, drawing upon various sources, and [[syncretic politics|syncretic]], combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches.{{sfn|perlin|1979}} the [[anti-capitalist]] tradition of classical anarchism has remained prominent within contemporary currents.{{sfn|williams|2018|p=4}}

various anarchist groups, tendencies, and schools of thought exist today, making it difficult to describe contemporary anarchist movement.{{sfn|franks|2013|pp=385–386}} while theorists and activists have established "relatively stable constellations of anarchist principles", there is no consensus on which principles are core. as a result, commentators describe multiple "anarchisms" (rather than a singular "anarchism") in which common principles are shared between schools of anarchism while each group prioritizes those principles differently. for example, gender equality can be a common principle but ranks as a higher priority to [[anarcha-feminists]] than [[anarchist communists]].{{sfn|franks|2013|p=386}} anarchists are generally committed against coercive authority in all forms, namely "all centralized and hierarchical forms of government (e.g., monarchy, representative democracy, state socialism, etc.), economic class systems (e.g., capitalism, bolshevism, feudalism, slavery, etc.), autocratic religions (e.g., fundamentalist islam, roman catholicism, etc.), patriarchy, heterosexism, white supremacy, and imperialism".{{sfn|jun|2009|pp=507–508}} however, anarchist schools disagree on the methods by which these forms should be opposed.{{sfn|jun|2009|p=507}}

== tactics ==
anarchists' tactics take various forms but in general serve two major goals—first, to oppose [[the establishment]]; and second, to promote anarchist ethics and reflect an anarchist vision of society, illustrating the unity of means and ends.{{sfn|williams|2019|pp=107–108}} a broad categorization can be made between aims to destroy oppressive states and institutions by revolutionary means, and aims to change society through evolutionary means.{{sfn|williams|2018|pp=4–5}} evolutionary tactics [[nonviolence|reject violence]] and take a gradual approach to anarchist aims, though there is significant overlap between the two.{{sfn|kinna|2019|p=125}}

anarchist tactics have shifted during the course of the last century. anarchists during the early 20th century focused more on strikes and militancy, while contemporary anarchists use a broader array of approaches.{{sfn|williams|2019|p=112}}

during the classical era, anarchists had a militant tendency. not only did they confront state armed forces (as in [[spain]] and [[ukraine]]) but some of them also employed [[terrorism]] as [[propaganda of the deed]]. assassination attempts were carried out against heads of state, some of which were successful. anarchists also took part in [[revolution]]s.{{sfn|williams|2019|pp=112–113}} anarchist perspectives towards violence have always been perplexing and controversial.{{sfn|carter|1978|p=320}} on one hand, [[anarcho-pacifism|anarcho-pacifists]] point out the unity of means and ends.{{sfn|fiala|2017}} on the other hand, other anarchist groups advocate direct action, a tactic which can include acts of [[sabotage]] or even acts of terrorism. this attitude was quite prominent a century ago; seeing the state as a [[tyrant]], some anarchists believed that they had every right to oppose its [[oppression]] by any means possible.{{sfn|kinna|2019|pp=116–117}} [[emma goldman]] and [[errico malatesta]], who were proponents of limited use of violence, argued that violence is merely a reaction to state violence as a [[necessary evil]].{{sfn|carter|1978|pp=320–325}}

anarchists took an active role in [[strike action|strikes]], although they tended to be antipathetic to formal [[syndicalism]], seeing it as [[reformism|reformist]]. they saw it as a part of the movement which sought to overthrow the [[state (polity)|state]] and [[capitalism]].{{sfn|williams|2019|p=113}} anarchists also reinforced their propaganda within the arts, some of whom practiced [[naturism|nudism]]. they also built communities which were based on [[friendship]]. they were also involved in the [[news media|press]].{{sfn|williams|2019|p=114}}

=== revolutionary tactics ===
in the current era, italian anarchist [[alfredo bonanno]], a proponent of [[insurrectionary anarchism]], has reinstated the debate on violence by rejecting the nonviolence tactic adopted since the late 19th century by kropotkin and other prominent anarchists afterwards. both bonanno and the french group [[the invisible committee]] advocate for small, informal affiliation groups, where each member is responsible for their own actions but works together to bring down oppression utilizing sabotage and other violent means against state, capitalism and other enemies. members of the invisible committee were arrested in 2008 on various charges, terrorism included.{{sfn|kinna|2019|pp=134–135}}

overall, today's anarchists are much less violent and militant than their ideological ancestors. they mostly engage in confronting the police during demonstrations and riots, especially in countries like [[anarchism in canada|canada]], [[anarchism in mexico|mexico]] or [[anarchism in greece|greece]]. μilitant [[black bloc]] protest groups are known for clashing with the police.{{sfn|williams|2019|p=115}} however, anarchists not only clash with state operators; they also engage in the struggle against fascists and racists, taking [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist action]] and mobilizing to prevent hate rallies from happening.{{sfn|williams|2019|p=117}}

=== evolutionary tactics ===
anarchists commonly employ [[direct action]]. this can take the form of disrupting and protesting against unjust [[hierarchy]], or the form of self-managing their lives through the creation of counter-institutions such as communes and non-hierarchical collectives.{{sfn|williams|2018|pp=4–5}} often, decision-making is handled in an anti-authoritarian way, with everyone having equal say in each decision, an approach known as [[horizontalidad|horizontalism]].{{sfn|williams|2019|pp=109–117}} contemporary-era anarchists have been engaging with various [[grassroots]] movements that are not explicitly anarchist but are more or less based on horizontalism, respecting personal autonomy, and participating in mass activism such as strikes and demonstrations. the newly coined term "small-a anarchism", in contrast with the "big-a anarchism" of the classical era, signals their tendency not to base their thoughts and actions on classical-era anarchism or to refer to kropotkin or proudhon to justify their opinions. they would rather base their thought and praxis on their own experience, which they will later theorize.{{sfn|kinna|2019|pp=145–149}}

the decision-making process of small [[affinity group|affinity anarchist groups]] play a significant tactical role.{{sfn|williams|2019|pp=109, 119}} anarchists have employed various methods in order to build a rough consensus among members of their group, without the need of a leader or a leading group. one way is for an individual from the group to play the role of facilitator to help achieve a consensus without taking part in the discussion themselves or promoting a specific point. minorities usually accept rough consensus, except when they feel the proposal contradicts anarchist goals, values, or ethics. anarchists usually form small groups (5–20 individuals) to enhance autonomy and friendships among their members. these kind of groups more often than not interconnect with each other, forming larger networks. anarchists still support and participate in strikes, especially [[wildcat strike action|wildcat strikes]]; these are leaderless strikes not organised centrally by a syndicate.{{sfn|williams|2019|p=119–121}}

anarchists have gone [[world wide web|online]] to spread their message. as in the past, newspapers and journals are used; however, because of distributional and other difficulties, anarchists have found it easier to create websites, hosting electronic libraries and other portals.{{sfn|williams|2019|pp=118–119}} anarchists were also involved in developing various software that are available for free. the way these hacktivists work to develop and distribute resembles the anarchist ideals, especially when it comes to preserving users' privacy from state surveillance.{{sfn|williams|2019|pp=120–121}}

anarchists organize themselves to [[squatting|squat]] and reclaim public spaces. during important events such as protests and when spaces are being occupied, they are often called [[temporary autonomous zone]]s (taz), spaces where [[surrealism]], poetry and art are blended to display the anarchist ideal.{{sfnm|1a1=kinna|1y=2019|1p=139|2a1=mattern|2y=2019|2p=596|3a1=williams|3y=2018|3pp=5–6}} as seen by anarchists, squatting is a way to regain urban space from the capitalist market, serving pragmatical needs, and is also seen an exemplary direct action.{{sfnm|1a1=kinna|1y=2012|1p=250|2a1=williams|2y=2019|2p=119}} acquiring space enables anarchists to experiment with their ideas and build social bonds.{{sfn|williams|2019|p=122}} adding up these tactics, and having in mind that not all anarchists share the same attitudes towards them, along with various forms of protesting at highly symbolic events, make up a [[carnivalesque|carnivalesque atmosphere]] that is part of contemporary anarchist vividity.{{sfn|morland|2004|p=37–38}}

{{main|issues in anarchism}}
<!-- in the interest of restricting article length, please limit this section to two or three short paragraphs and add any substantial information to the main issues in anarchism article. thank you. -->
as anarchism is a [[philosophy]] that embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies, and schools of thought, and disagreement over questions of values, ideology, and tactics is common, its diversity has led to widely different uses of identical terms among different anarchist traditions, which has created a number of [[definitional concerns in anarchist theory]]. for instance, the compatibility of [[anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]],{{sfnm|1a1=marshall|1y=1993|1p=565|1ps=: "in fact, few anarchists would accept the 'anarcho-capitalists' into the anarchist camp since they do not share a concern for economic equality and social justice, their self-interested, calculating market men would be incapable of practising voluntary co-operation and mutual aid. anarcho-capitalists, even if they do reject the state, might therefore best be called right-wing libertarians rather than anarchists."|2a1=honderich|2y=1995|2p=31|3a1=meltzer|3y=2000|3p=50|3ps=: "the philosophy of "anarcho-capitalism" dreamed up by the "libertarian" [[new right]], has nothing to do with anarchism as known by the anarchist movement proper."|4a1=goodway|4y=2006|4p=4|4ps=: "'libertarian' and 'libertarianism' are frequently employed by anarchists as synonyms for 'anarchist' and 'anarchism', largely as an attempt to distance themselves from the negative connotations of 'anarchy' and its derivatives. the situation has been vastly complicated in recent decades with the rise of anarcho-capitalism, 'minimal statism' and an extreme right-wing laissez-faire philosophy advocated by such theorists as murray rothbard and robert nozick and their adoption of the words 'libertarian' and 'libertarianism'. it has therefore now become necessary to distinguish between their right libertarianism and the left libertarianism of the anarchist tradition."|5a1=newman|5y=2010|5p=53|5ps=: "it is important to distinguish between anarchism and certain strands of right-wing libertarianism which at times go by the same name (for example, murray rothbard's anarcho-capitalism)."}} [[anarchism and nationalism|nationalism]] and [[anarchism and religion|religion]] with anarchism is widely disputed. similarly, anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as [[anarchism and marxism|marxism]], [[issues in anarchism#communism|communism]], [[collectivism]] and [[trade unionism]]. anarchists may be motivated by [[humanism]], [[god|divine authority]], [[enlightened self-interest]], [[veganarchism|veganism]], or any number of alternative ethical doctrines. phenomena such as [[civilisation]], [[technology]] (e.g. within [[anarcho-primitivism]]) and the [[issues in anarchism#participation in statist democracy|democratic process]] may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others.{{sfn|de george|2005|pp=31–32}}

=== gender, sexuality and free love ===
{{main|free love}}
{{see also|anarchism and issues related to love and sex|queer anarchism}}
[[file:emilearmand01.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[individualist anarchism in france|french individualist anarchist]] [[émile armand]] propounded the virtues of [[free love]] in the [[anarchism in france|parisian anarchist milieu]] of the early 20th century]]
gender and sexuality carry along them dynamics of hierarchy; anarchism is obliged to address, analyse and oppose the suppression of one's autonomy because of the dynamics that gender roles traditionally impose.{{sfn|nicholas|2019|p=603}}

a historical current that arose and flourished during 1890 and 1920 within anarchism was [[free love]]; in contemporary anarchism, this current survives as a tendency to support [[polyamory]] and [[queer anarchism]].{{sfnm|1a1=nicholas|1y=2019|1p=611|2a1=jeppesen|2a2=nazar|2y=2012|2pp=175–176}} free love advocates were against marriage, which they saw as a way of men imposing authority over women, largely because marriage law greatly favoured the power of men. the notion of free love, though, was much broader; it included critique of the established order that limited women's sexual freedom and pleasure.{{sfn|jeppesen|nazar|2012|pp=175–176}} such free love movements contributed to the establishment of communal houses, where large groups of travelers, anarchists, and other activists slept in beds together.{{sfn|jeppesen|nazar|2012|p=177}} free love had roots both in europe and the united states. some anarchists, however, struggled with the jealousy that arose from free love.{{sfn|jeppesen|nazar|2012|pp=175–177}} anarchist feminists were advocates of free love, against marriage, were pro-choice (utilizing a contemporary term) and had a likewise agenda. anarchist and non-anarchist feminists differed on [[suffrage]], but were nonetheless supportive of one another.{{sfn|kinna2019|pp=166–167}}

during the second half of the 20th century, anarchism intermingled with the [[second-wave feminism|second wave of feminism]], radicalizing some currents of the feminist movement (and being influenced as well). by the latest decades of the 20th century, anarchists and feminists were advocating for the rights and autonomy of women, gays, queers and other marginalized groups, with some feminist thinkers suggesting a fusion of the two currents.{{sfn|nicholas|2019|pp=609–611}} with the [[third-wave feminism|third wave of feminism]], sexual identity and compulsory heterosexuality became a subject of study for anarchists, which yielded a [[post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] critique of sexual normality.{{sfn|nicholas|2019|pp=610–611}} however, some anarchists distanced themselves from this line of thinking, suggesting that it leaned towards individualism and was, therefore, dropping the cause of social liberation.{{sfn|nicholas|2019|pp=616–617}}

the interest of anarchists in education stretches back to the first emergence of classical anarchism. anarchists consider 'proper' education, which sets the foundations of the future autonomy of the individual and the society, to be an act of [[mutual aid (organization theory)|mutual aid]].{{sfnm|1a1=kinna|1y=2019|1pp=83–85|2a2=suissa|2y=2019|2pp=514–515, 520}} anarchist writers such as [[william godwin|willian godwin]] and [[max stirner]] attacked both state education and private education as another means by which the ruling class replicate their privileges.{{sfnm|1a1=suissa|1y=2019|1pp=514, 521|2a1=kinna|2y=2019|2pp=83–86|3a1=marshall|3y=1993|3p=222|3ps=. max stirner recorded his thoughts in an essay on education titled "[[the false principle of our education]]". william godwin's thoughts can be found in his ''[[political justice]]''.}}

in 1901, catalan anarchist and free thinker [[francisco ferrer]] established the [[ferrer movement|escuela moderna]] in barcelona as an opposition to the established education system, which was dictated largely by the catholic church.{{sfn|suissa|2019|pp=511–512}} ferrer's approach was secular, rejecting both state and church involvement in the educational process, and gave pupils large amounts of autonomy in planning their work and attendance. ferrer aimed to educate the working class and explicitly sought to foster [[class consciousness]] among students. the school closed after constant harassment by the state and ferrer was later arrested. his ideas, however, formed the inspiration for a series of [[modern school (united states)|modern schools]] around the world.{{sfn|suissa|2019|pp=511–514}} christian anarchist [[leo tolstoy]] also established a similar school, with its founding principle, according to tolstoy, being that "for education to be effective it had to be free".{{sfn|suissa|2019|pp=517–518|ps=. for more, see tolstoy essay's ''education and culture''.}} in a similar token, a. s. neill founding what became [[summerhill school]] in 1921, also declaring being free from coercion.{{sfn|suissa|2019|pp=518–519}}

anarchist education is based largely on the idea that a child's right to develop freely, without manipulation, ought to be respected, and that rationality will lead children to morally good conclusions. however, there has been little consensus among anarchist figures as to what constitutes manipulation; ferrer, for example, believed that moral indoctrination was necessary and explicitly taught pupils that equality, liberty, and social justice were not possible under capitalism (along with other critiques of nationalism and government).{{sfn|suissa|2019|pp=519–522}}{{sfn|avrich|1980|pp=3–33}}

late 20th century and contemporary anarchist writers (such as [[colin ward]], [[herbert read]] and [[paul goodman]]) intensified and expanded the anarchist critique of state education, largely focusing on the need for a system that focuses on children's creativity rather than on their ability to attain a career or participate in [[consumerism|consumer society]].{{sfn|kinna|2019|pp=89–96}} contemporary anarchists, such as [[colin ward]], have further argued that state education serves to perpetuate socio-economic inequality.{{sfn|ward|1973|pp=39–48}}

while few anarchist education institutions have survived to the modern day, major tenets of anarchist schools, such as respect for child autonomy and relying on reasoning rather than indoctrination as a teaching method, have spread among mainstream educational institutions.{{sfn|suissa|2019|pp=523–526|ps=. suissa names three schools as explicitly anarchists schools, namely the free skool santa cruz in the united states which is part of a wider american-canadian network of schools; self-managed learning college in brighton, england; and paideia school in spain.}}

=== anarchism and the state ===
<!-- important! strive to explain how anarchists perceive authority and oppression and why they reject them. jun (2019), p. 41. -->
objection to the [[state (polity)|state]] and its institutions is a ''[[sine qua non]]'' of anarchism.{{sfnm|1a1=carter|1y=1971|1p=14|2a1=jun|2y=2019|2pp=29–30}} anarchists consider the state as a tool of domination and believe it to be illegitimate regardless of its political tendencies. instead of people being able to control the aspects of their life, major decisions are taken by a small elite. authority ultimately rests solely on power, regardless of whether that power is [[open government|open]] or [[transparency (behavior)|transparent]], as it still has the ability to coerce people. another anarchist argument against states is that the people constituting a government, even the most altruistic among officials, will unavoidably seek to gain more power, leading to corruption. anarchists consider the idea that the state is the collective will of the people to be an unachievable fiction, due to the fact that the [[ruling class]] is distinct from the rest of society.{{sfn|jun|2019|pp=32–38}}

=== anarchism and art ===
[[file:apple harvest by camille pissarro.jpg|thumb|340px|''les chataigniers a osny'' by anarchist painter [[camille pissarro]]. 19th century [[neo-impressionism|neo-impressionist movement]] had an ecological aesthetic and offered an example of an anarchist perception of the road towards socialism.{{sfn|antliff|1998|p=78}} in this specific painting, note how the blending of aestetic and social harmony is prefiguring an ideal anarchistic agrarian community.{{sfn|antliff|1998|p=99}}]]{{see also|anarchism and the arts}}the connection between anarchism and art was quite profound during the classical era of anarchism, especially among artistic currents that were developing during that era, such as futurists, surrealists, and others,{{sfn|mattern|2019|p=592}} while in literature anarchism was mostly associated with the [[new apocalyptics]] and the [[neo-romanticism]] movement.{{snf|gifford|2019|p=577}} in music, anarchism has been associated with music scenes such as punk.{{sfn|allmusic}} anarchists such as leo tolstoy and herbert read argued that the border between the artist and the non-artist, what separates art from a daily act, is a construct produced by the alienation caused by capitalism, and it prevents humans from living a joyful life.{{sfn|mattern|2019|pp=592–593}}

other anarchists advocated for or used art as a means to achieve anarchist ends.{{sfn|mattern|2019|p=593}} in his book breaking the spell: a history of anarchist filmmakers, videotape guerrillas, and digital ninjas, chris robé claims that "anarchist-inflected practices have increasingly structured movement-based video activism."{{sfn|robé|2017|p=44}}

throughout the 20th century many prominent anarchists, such as peter kropotkin, emma goldman, gustav landauer, and camillo berneri, and publications, such as ''[[anarchy (magazine)|anarchy]]'', wrote about matters pertaining to the arts.{{sfn|a. miller|2019|p=1}}

three overlapping properties made art useful to anarchists: it could depict a critique of existing society and hierarchies; it could serve as a prefigurative tool to reflect the anarchist ideal society, and also it could turn into a means of direct action, in protests for example. as it appeals to both emotion and reason, art could appeal to the "whole human" and have a powerful effect.{{sfn|mattern|2019|pp=593–596}}

== criticism{{anchor|criticisms}} ==
the most common critique of anarchism is that humans can not self govern and a state is necessary for human survival.{{sfn|peterson|1987|p=238}} philosopher [[bertrand russell]] supported this critique, noting that "peace and war, tariffs, regulations of sanitary conditions and the sale of noxious drugs, the preservation of a just system of distribution: these, among others, are functions which could hardly be performed in a community in which there was no central government."{{sfn|peterson|1987|p=238}}

philosophy lecturer andrew g. fiala also believed that humans could not self govern and included it in his list of arguments against anarchism. fiala's other critiques were that anarchism is innately related to violence and destruction, not only in the pragmatic world (i.e. at protests) but in the world of ethics as well. secondly, anarchism is evaluated as unfeasible or utopian since the state can not be defeated practically; this line of arguments most often calls for political action within the system to reform it. the third argument is that anarchism is self-contradictory since while it advocates for no-one to ''archiei'', if accepted by the many, then anarchism will turn into the ruling political theory. in this line of criticism also comes the self contradiction that anarchist calls for collective action while anarchism endorses the autonomy of the individual and hence no collective action can be taken. lastly, fiala mentions a critique towards philosophical anarchism, of being ineffective (all talk and thoughts) and in the meantime capitalism and bourgeois class remains strong.{{sfn|fiala|2017|loc="4. objections and replies"}}

philosophical anarchism has met the criticism of members of academia, following the release of pro-anarchist books such as [[a. john simmons]]' ''moral principles and political obligations'' (1979).{{sfn|klosko|1999|p=536}} law professor william a. edmundson authored an essay arguing against three major philosophical anarchist principles, which he finds fallacious; edmundson claims that while the individual does not owe a normal state{{ambiguous|date=june 2020}} a duty of obedience, this does not imply that anarchism is the inevitable conclusion, and the state is still morally legitimate.{{sfnm|1a1=klosko|1y=1999|1p=536|2a1=kristjánsson|2y=2000|2p=896}}

academic [[john molyneux (academic)|john molyneux]] notes in his book ''anarchism: a marxist criticism'' that "anarchism cannot win" believing that it lacks the ability to properly implement its ideas.{{sfn|dodds|2011}}

children with high-functioning autism have more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non-autistic peers, despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone. making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism. for them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they feel. functional friendships, such as those resulting in invitations to parties, may affect the quality of life more deeply.<ref name=burgess/>

in a pair of studies, high-functioning children with autism aged 8–15 performed equally well as, and as adults better than, individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling. both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language, comprehension and inference. as people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills, these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends.<ref name="williams">{{cite journal | vauthors = williams dl, goldstein g, minshew nj | title = neuropsychologic functioning in children with autism: further evidence for disordered complex information-processing | journal = child neuropsychol | volume = 12 | issue = 4–5 | pages = 279–298 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16911973 | pmc = 1803025 | doi = 10.1080/09297040600681190}}</ref>

===repetitive behavior===
[[file:autistic-sweetiepie-boy-with-ducksinarow.jpg|thumb|alt=sleeping boy beside a dozen or so toys arranged in a line|a young boy with autism who has arranged his toys in a row]]
autistic individuals can display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior, which the repetitive behavior scale-revised (rbs-r) categorizes as follows.<ref name=lam-aman/>

* [[stereotypy|stereotyped behaviors]]: repetitive movements, such as hand flapping, head rolling, or body rocking.
* [[compulsive behavior]]s: time-consuming behaviors intended to reduce anxiety that an individual feels compelled to perform repeatedly or according to rigid rules, such as placing objects in a specific order, checking things, or hand washing.
* sameness: resistance to change; for example, insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted.
* [[ritual#psychology|ritualistic behavior]]: unvarying pattern of daily activities, such as an unchanging menu or a dressing ritual. this is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the two factors.<ref name="lam-aman">{{cite journal | vauthors = lam ks, aman mg | s2cid = 41034513 | title = the repetitive behavior scale-revised: independent validation in individuals with autism spectrum disorders | journal = j autism dev disord | volume = 37 | issue = 5 | pages = 855–866 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17048092 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-006-0213-z | url = https://www.academia.edu/14013119}}</ref>
* restricted interests: interests or fixations that are abnormal in theme or intensity of focus, such as preoccupation with a single television program, toy, or game.
* [[self-injury]]: behaviors such as eye-poking, [[dermatillomania|skin-picking]], hand-biting and head-banging.<ref name=john2007/>

several other conditions are common in children with autism.<ref name=lev2009/> they include:

* '''[[anxiety disorder]]s''' are common among children with asd; there are no firm data, but studies have reported prevalences ranging from 11% to 84%. many anxiety disorders have symptoms that are better explained by asd itself, or are hard to distinguish from asd's symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = white sw, oswald d, ollendick t, scahill l | title = anxiety in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders | journal = clin psychol rev | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 216–229 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19223098 | pmc = 2692135 | doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2009.01.003}}</ref>

* '''preempted diagnoses'''. although the dsm-iv rules out concurrent diagnosis of many other conditions along with autism, the full criteria for [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (adhd), [[tourette syndrome]], and other of these conditions are often present and these [[conditions comorbid to autism spectrum disorders|comorbid diagnoses]] are increasingly accepted.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = steyaert jg, de la marche w | s2cid = 11831418 | title = what's new in autism? | journal = eur j pediatr | volume = 167 | issue = 10 | pages = 1091–1101 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18597114 | doi = 10.1007/s00431-008-0764-4 | url = https://www.academia.edu/24262348}}</ref>
* '''sleep problems''' affect about two-thirds of individuals with asd at some point in childhood. these most commonly include symptoms of [[insomnia]] such as difficulty in falling asleep, frequent [[middle-of-the-night insomnia|nocturnal awakenings]], and early morning awakenings. sleep problems are associated with difficult behaviors and family stress, and are often a focus of clinical attention over and above the primary asd diagnosis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = richdale al, schreck ka | title = sleep problems in autism spectrum disorders: prevalence, nature, & possible biopsychosocial aetiologies | journal = sleep med rev | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 403–411 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19398354 | doi = 10.1016/j.smrv.2009.02.003}}</ref>

kanner's reuse of ''autism'' led to decades of confused terminology like ''infantile schizophrenia'', and child psychiatry's focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant's response to "[[refrigerator mother]]s". starting in the late 1960s autism was established as a separate syndrome.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = fombonne e | s2cid = 8868418 | title = modern views of autism | journal = can j psychiatry | volume = 48 | issue = 8 | pages = 503–505 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14574825 | url = http://ww1.cpa-apc.org/publications/archives/cjp/2003/september/guesteditorial.asp| doi = 10.1177/070674370304800801}}</ref>

=== autism rights movement ===
the [[autism rights movement]] is a [[social movement]] within the context of [[disability rights movement|disability right]]s that emphasizes the concept of [[neurodiversity]], viewing the autism spectrum as a result of natural variations in the [[human brain]] rather than a disorder to be cured.<ref name="solomon"/> the autism rights movement advocates for including greater acceptance of autistic behaviors; therapies that focus on coping skills rather than on imitating the behaviors of those without autism,<ref name=bigthink>{{cite web |last1=ratner |first1=paul | name-list-format = vanc  |title=should autism be cured or is "curing" offensive? |url=https://bigthink.com/paul-ratner/should-autism-be-cured-or-is-curing-offfensive |website=big think |access-date=16 june 2019 |date=10 july 2016}}</ref> and the recognition of the autistic community as a [[minority group]].<ref name=bigthink/><ref name= jaarsma2012>{{cite journal | vauthors = jaarsma p, welin s | s2cid = 18618887 | title = autism as a natural human variation: reflections on the claims of the neurodiversity movement | journal = health care analysis | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 20–30 | date = march 2012 | pmid = 21311979 | doi = 10.1007/s10728-011-0169-9 | url = http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-72172 }}</ref> autism rights or neurodiversity advocates believe that the autism spectrum is genetic and should be accepted as a natural expression of the [[human genome]]. this perspective is distinct from two other likewise distinct views: the medical perspective, that autism is caused by a genetic defect and should be addressed by targeting the autism gene(s), and [[fringe theories]] that autism is caused by environmental factors such as [[vaccine]]s.<ref name="solomon"/> a common criticism against autistic activists is that the majority of them are "[[high-functioning autism|high-functioning]]" or have [[asperger syndrome]] and do not represent the views of "[[low-functioning autism|low-functioning]]" autistic people.<ref name= jaarsma2012/>

[[file:albedo-e hg.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|the percentage of [[diffuse reflection|diffusely reflected]] [[sunlight]] relative to various surface conditions]]

'''albedo''' ({{ipac-en|æ|l|ˈ|b|iː|d|oʊ}}) ({{lang-la|albedo}}, meaning 'whiteness') is the measure of the [[diffuse reflection]] of [[sunlight|solar radiation]] out of the total [[solar radiation]] and measured on a scale from 0, corresponding to a [[black body]] that absorbs all incident radiation, to 1, corresponding to a body that reflects all incident radiation.

surface albedo is defined as the ratio of [[radiosity (radiometry)|radiosity]] to the [[irradiance]] (flux per unit area) received by a surface.<ref>http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~parent.1/classes/782/lectures/03_radiometry.pdf</ref> the proportion reflected is not only determined by properties of the surface itself, but also by the spectral and angular distribution of solar radiation reaching the earth's surface.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://curry.eas.gatech.edu/courses/6140/ency/chapter9/ency_atmos/reflectance_albedo_surface.pdf |title=reflectance and albedo, surface |encyclopedia=encyclopedia of the atmosphere |editor=j. r. holton |editor2=j. a. curry |last=coakley |first=j. a. |publisher=academic press |year=2003|pages=1914–1923}}</ref> these factors vary with atmospheric composition, geographic location and time (see [[position of the sun]]). while bi-hemispherical [[reflectance]] is calculated for a single angle of incidence (i.e., for a given position of the sun), albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in a given period. the temporal resolution may range from seconds (as obtained from flux measurements) to daily, monthly, or annual averages.

unless given for a specific wavelength (spectral albedo), albedo refers to the entire spectrum of solar radiation.<ref>{{cite journal |last=henderson-sellers |first=a. |last2=wilson |first2=m. f.|year=1983 |quote=albedo observations of the earth's surface for climate research |jstor=37357 |journal=philosophical transactions of the royal society of london a |volume=309 |issue=1508 |title=the study of the ocean and the land surface from satellites |pages=285–294 |bibcode=1983rspta.309..285h |doi=10.1098/rsta.1983.0042}}</ref> due to measurement constraints, it is often given for the spectrum in which most solar energy reaches the surface (between 0.3 and 3 μm). this spectrum includes [[visible spectrum|visible light]] (0.4–0.7 μm), which explains why surfaces with a low albedo appear dark (e.g., trees absorb most radiation), whereas surfaces with a high albedo appear bright (e.g., snow reflects most radiation).

albedo is an important concept in [[climatology]], [[astronomy]], and environmental management (e.g., as part of the [[leadership in energy and environmental design]] (leed) program for sustainable rating of buildings). the average albedo of the earth from the upper atmosphere, its ''planetary albedo'', is 30–35% because of [[cloud cover]], but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features.<ref>{{cite book |title=environmental encyclopedia |url=https://archive.org/details/environmentalenc01cunn |url-access=registration |edition=3rd |publisher=thompson gale |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-7876-5486-3}}</ref>

the term albedo was introduced into optics by [[johann heinrich lambert]] in his 1760 work ''[[photometria]]''.

any albedo in visible light falls within a range of about 0.9 for fresh snow to about 0.04 for charcoal, one of the darkest substances. deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a [[black body]]. when seen from a distance, the ocean surface has a low albedo, as do most forests, whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms. most land areas are in an albedo range of 0.1 to 0.4.<ref name="physicsworld">{{cite web|url=http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/albedo.html |title=albedo – from eric weisstein's world of physics |publisher=scienceworld.wolfram.com |accessdate=19 august 2011}}</ref> the average albedo of [[earth]] is about 0.3.<ref name="goode"/> this is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds.

[[file:ceres 2003 2004 clear sky total sky albedo.png|thumb|upright=1.2|left|2003–2004 mean annual clear-sky and total-sky albedo]]
earth's surface albedo is regularly estimated via [[earth observation]] satellite sensors such as [[nasa]]'s [[modis]] instruments on board the [[terra (satellite)|terra]] and [[aqua (satellite)|aqua]] satellites, and the ceres instrument on the [[suomi npp]] and [[joint polar satellite system|jpss]]. as the amount of reflected radiation is only measured for a single direction by satellite, not all directions, a mathematical model is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of [[directional-hemispherical reflectance]] and bi-hemispherical reflectance (e.g.,<ref name="nasa"/>). these calculations are based on the [[bidirectional reflectance distribution function]] (brdf), which describes how the reflectance of a given surface depends on the view angle of the observer and the solar angle. bdrf can facilitate translations of observations of reflectance into albedo.

earth's average surface temperature due to its albedo and the [[greenhouse effect]] is currently about 15&nbsp;°c. if earth were frozen entirely (and hence be more reflective), the average temperature of the planet would drop below −40&nbsp;°c.<ref name="washington" /> if only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers, the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about 0&nbsp;°c.<ref name="clim-past"/> in contrast, if the entire earth was covered by water – a so-called [[ocean planet]] – the average temperature on the planet would rise to almost 27&nbsp;°c.<ref name="smith robin"/>

===white-sky, black-sky, and blue-sky albedo===
for land surfaces, it has been shown that the albedo at a particular [[solar zenith angle]] ''θ''<sub>''i''</sub> can be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms:
* the [[directional-hemispherical reflectance]] at that solar zenith angle, <math>{\bar \alpha(\theta_i)}</math>, sometimes referred to as black-sky albedo, and
* the [[bi-hemispherical reflectance]], <math>\bar{ \bar \alpha}</math>, sometimes referred to as white-sky albedo.
with <math>{1-d}</math> being the proportion of direct radiation from a given solar angle, and <math>{d}</math> being the proportion of diffuse illumination, the actual albedo <math>{\alpha}</math> (also called blue-sky albedo) can then be given as:

:<math>{\alpha}= (1-d) \bar \alpha(\theta_i) + d \bar{ \bar \alpha}.</math>

this formula is important because it allows the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface.<ref name="blueskyalbedo"/>

== astronomical albedo ==

the albedos of [[planet]]s, [[natural satellite|satellites]] and [[minor planet]]s such as [[asteroid]]s can be used to infer much about their properties. the study of albedos, their dependence on wavelength, lighting angle ("phase angle"), and variation in time composes a major part of the astronomical field of [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]]. for small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes, much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos. for example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer [[solar system]] objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about [[regolith]] properties, whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in [[asteroid]]s.

[[enceladus]], a moon of saturn, has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the solar system, with an albedo of 0.99. another notable high-albedo body is [[eris (dwarf planet)|eris]], with an albedo of 0.96.<ref name="sicardy">

in detailed studies, the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five [[hapke parameters]] which semi-empirically describe the variation of albedo with [[phase angle (astronomy)|phase angle]], including a characterization of the opposition effect of [[regolith]] surfaces.

==examples of terrestrial albedo effects==

===illumination===
albedo is not directly dependent on illumination because changing the amount of incoming light proportionally changes the amount of reflected light, except in circumstances where a change in illumination induces a change in the earth's surface at that location (e.g. through melting of reflective ice). that said, albedo and illumination both vary by latitude. albedo is highest near the poles and lowest in the subtropics, with a local maximum in the tropics.<ref name=winston>{{cite journal| first=jay |last=winston |title=the annual course of zonal mean albedo as derived from essa 3 and 5 digitized picture data |journal=monthly weather review |volume=99 |pages=818–827| bibcode=1971mwrv...99..818w| date=1971| doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1971)099<0818:tacozm>2.3.co;2| issue=11}}</ref>

===insolation effects===
the intensity of albedo temperature effects depends on the amount of albedo and the level of local [[insolation]] (solar irradiance); high albedo areas in the [[arctic]] and [[antarctic]] regions are cold due to low insolation, whereas areas such as the [[sahara desert]], which also have a relatively high albedo, will be hotter due to high insolation.  [[tropical]] and [[sub-tropical]] [[rainforest]] areas have low albedo, and are much hotter than their [[temperate forest]] counterparts, which have lower insolation. because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo, high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes.{{citation needed|date=november 2013}}

arctic regions notably release more heat back into space than what they absorb, effectively cooling the [[earth]]. this has been a concern since arctic ice and [[snow]] has been melting at higher rates due to higher temperatures, creating regions in the arctic that are notably darker (being water or ground which is darker color) and reflects less heat back into space. this [[ice-albedo feedback|feedback loop]] results in a reduced albedo effect.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21721364-commercial-opportunities-are-vastly-outweighed-damage-climate-thawing-arctic|title=the thawing arctic threatens an environmental catastrophe|journal=the economist|access-date=8 may 2017|date=29 april 2017}}</ref>

===climate and weather===
albedo affects [[climate]] by determining how much [[radiation]] a planet absorbs.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=av7q4n8ib6sc&pg=pa53|title=encyclopedia of climate and weather: abs-ero|last=schneider|first=stephen henry|last2=mastrandrea|first2=michael d.|last3=root|first3=terry l.|date=2011|publisher=oxford university press|isbn=978-0-19-976532-4|page=53}}</ref> the uneven heating of earth from albedo variations between land, ice, or ocean surfaces can drive [[weather]].

===albedo–temperature feedback===
when an area's albedo changes due to snowfall, a snow–temperature [[feedback]] results. a layer of snowfall increases local albedo, reflecting away sunlight, leading to local cooling. in principle, if no outside temperature change affects this area (e.g., a warm [[air mass]]), the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall, deepening the snow–temperature feedback. however, because local [[weather]] is dynamic due to the change of [[season]]s, eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight (higher [[insolation]]) cause melting. when the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo, such as grass or soil, the effect is reversed: the darkening surface lowers albedo, increasing local temperatures, which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further, resulting in still more heating.

===snow===
snow albedo is highly variable, ranging from as high as 0.9 for freshly fallen snow, to about 0.4 for melting snow, and as low as 0.2 for dirty snow.<ref>hall, d.k. and martinec, j. (1985), ''remote sensing of ice and snow''. chapman and hall, new york, 189 pp.</ref> over [[antarctica]] snow albedo averages a little more than 0.8. if a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack (the ice–albedo [[positive feedback]]).

just as fresh snow has a higher albedo than does dirty snow, the albedo of snow-covered sea ice is far higher than that of sea water. sea water absorbs more solar radiation than would the same surface covered with reflective snow. when sea ice melts, either due to a rise in sea temperature or in response to increased solar radiation from above, the snow-covered surface is reduced, and more surface of sea water is exposed, so the rate of energy absorption increases. the extra absorbed energy heats the sea water, which in turn increases the rate at which sea ice melts. as with the preceding example of snowmelt, the process of melting of sea ice is thus another example of a positive feedback.<ref>"all about sea ice." national snow and ice data center. accessed 16 november 2017. /cryosphere/seaice/index.html.</ref> both positive feedback loops have long been recognized as important for [[global warming]].{{citation needed|date=january 2018}}

[[cryoconite]], powdery windblown [[dust]] containing soot, sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets.<ref name = "nat. geo">[http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2010/06/melt-zone/jenkins-text/3 "changing greenland – melt zone"] page 3, of 4, article by mark jenkins in ''[[national geographic (magazine)|national geographic]]'' june 2010, accessed 8 july 2010</ref>

the dynamical nature of albedo in response to positive feedback, together with the effects of small errors in the measurement of albedo, can lead to large errors in energy estimates. because of this, in order to reduce the error of energy estimates, it is important to measure the albedo of snow-covered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying a single value for albedo over broad regions.{{citation needed|date=january 2018}}

===small-scale effects===
albedo works on a smaller scale, too. in sunlight, dark clothes absorb more heat and light-coloured clothes reflect it better, thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing.<ref name="ranknfile-ue">{{cite web|url=http://www.ranknfile-ue.org/h&s0897.html |title=health and safety: be cool!

=== solar photovoltaic effects ===
albedo can affect the [[electrical energy]] output of solar [[photovoltaic system|photovoltaic devices]]. for example, the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-si:h) and crystalline silicon (c-si)-based compared to traditional spectral-integrated albedo predictions. research showed impacts of over 10%.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = andrews | first1 = rob w. | last2 = pearce | first2 = joshua m. | date = 2013 | title = the effect of spectral albedo on amorphous silicon and crystalline silicon solar photovoltaic device performance | journal = solar energy | volume = 91 | pages = 233–241 | doi = 10.1016/j.solener.2013.01.030 |bibcode = 2013soen...91..233a | url = https://www.academia.edu/3081684 }}</ref> more recently, the analysis was extended to the effects of spectral bias due to the specular reflectivity of 22 commonly occurring surface materials (both human-made and natural) and analyzes the albedo effects on the performance of seven photovoltaic materials covering three common photovoltaic system topologies: industrial (solar farms), commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched-roof applications.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = brennan | first1 = m.p. | authorlink4 = j. m. pearce | last2 = abramase | first2 = a.l. | last3 = andrews | first3 = r.w. | last4 = pearce | first4 = j. m. | date = 2014 | title = effects of spectral albedo on solar photovoltaic devices | journal = solar energy materials and solar cells | volume = 124 | pages = 111–116 | doi = 10.1016/j.solmat.2014.01.046 | url = https://www.academia.edu/6222506 }}</ref>

===trees===
because forests generally have a low albedo, (the majority of the ultraviolet and [[visible spectrum]] is absorbed through [[photosynthesis]]), some scientists have suggested that greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of afforestation (or offset the negative climate impacts of [[deforestation]]). in the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be great enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling effect.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = betts | first1 = ra | date = 2000 | title = offset of the potential carbon sink from boreal forestation by decreases in surface albedo | journal = nature | volume = 408 | issue = 6809| pages = 187–190 | doi = 10.1038/35041545 | pmid=11089969|bibcode = 2000natur.408..187b }}</ref> trees also impact climate in extremely complicated ways through [[evapotranspiration]]. the water vapor causes cooling on the land surface, causes heating where it condenses, acts a strong greenhouse gas, and can increase albedo when it condenses into clouds.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = boucher | date = 2004 | title = direct human influence of irrigation on atmospheric water vapour and climate | journal = climate dynamics | volume = 22 | issue = 6–7| pages = 597–603 | doi=10.1007/s00382-004-0402-4|display-authors=etal|bibcode = 2004cldy...22..597b | url = https://www.academia.edu/25329256}}</ref> scientists generally treat evapotranspiration as a net cooling impact, and the net climate impact of albedo and evapotranspiration changes from deforestation depends greatly on local climate.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = bonan | first1 = gb | date = 2008 | title = forests and climate change: forcings, feedbacks, and the climate benefits of forests | journal = science | volume = 320 | issue = 5882| pages = 1444–1449 | doi = 10.1126/science.1155121 | pmid=18556546|bibcode = 2008sci...320.1444b  | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1230896 }}</ref>

in seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily. [[deciduous trees]] have an albedo value of about 0.15 to 0.18 whereas [[coniferous trees]] have a value of about 0.09 to 0.15.<ref name="mmutrees" /> variation in summer albedo across both forest types is correlated with maximum rates of photosynthesis because plants with high growth capacity display a greater fraction of their foliage for direct interception of incoming radiation in the upper canopy.<ref name="ollinger">{{cite journal

}}</ref> the result is that wavelengths of light not used in photosynthesis are more likely to be reflected back to space rather than being absorbed by other surfaces lower in the canopy.

studies by the [[hadley centre]] have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of [[carbon sequestration]] on planting forests. they found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g., siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming.<ref name="betts" />

===water===
[[file:water reflectivity.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|reflectivity of smooth water at 20&nbsp;°c (refractive index=1.333)]]
water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials. the reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the [[fresnel equations]] (see graph).

at the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally [[specular reflection|specular manner]] (not [[diffuse reflection|diffusely]]). the glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this. at small [[angle of incidence (optics)|angles of incident]] light, [[waviness]] results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle.<ref name="fresnel" />

although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of earth near the [[terminator (solar)|terminator]] (early morning, late afternoon, and near the poles). however, as mentioned above, waviness causes an appreciable reduction. because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light.

note that white caps on waves look white (and have high albedo) because the water is foamed up, so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect, adding up their reflectivities. fresh 'black' ice exhibits fresnel reflection.
snow on top of this sea ice increases the albedo to 0.9.{{citation needed|date=december 2017}}

===clouds===
[[cloud albedo]] has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures. different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity, theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0.8. "on any given day, about half of earth is covered by clouds, which reflect more sunlight than land and water. clouds keep earth cool by reflecting sunlight, but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth."<ref name="livescience">{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/environment/060124_earth_albedo.html |title=baffled scientists say less sunlight reaching earth |publisher=livescience |date=24 january 2006 |accessdate=19 august 2011}}</ref>

===aerosol effects===
[[aerosols]] (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) have both direct and indirect effects on earth's radiative balance. the direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as [[cloud condensation nuclei]] and thereby change cloud properties) is less certain.<ref name="girda">{{cite web|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm#671 |title=climate change 2001: the scientific basis |publisher=grida.no |accessdate=19 august 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110629175429/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm| archivedate= 29 june 2011<!--added by dashbot-->}}</ref> as per spracklen et al.<ref name="dominick" /> the effects are:
<blockquote>
<!-- aerosol radiative forcing. -->
* ''aerosol direct effect.'' aerosols directly scatter and absorb radiation. the scattering of radiation causes atmospheric cooling, whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming.
* ''aerosol indirect effect.'' aerosols modify the properties of clouds through a subset of the aerosol population called [[cloud condensation nuclei]]. increased nuclei concentrations lead to increased cloud droplet number concentrations, which in turn leads to increased cloud albedo, increased light scattering and radiative cooling (''first indirect effect''), but also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased lifetime of the cloud (''second indirect effect'').

another albedo-related effect on the climate is from [[black carbon]] particles. the size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the [[intergovernmental panel on climate change]] estimates that the global mean [[radiative forcing]] for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is +0.2 w m<sup>−2</sup>, with a range +0.1 to +0.4 w m<sup>−2</sup>.<ref name="girda 1">{{cite web|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/233.htm |title=climate change 2001: the scientific basis |publisher=grida.no |accessdate=19 august 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110629180154/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/233.htm| archivedate= 29 june 2011<!--added by dashbot-->}}</ref> black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo.<ref>james hansen & larissa nazarenko, ''soot climate forcing via snow and ice albedos'', 101 proc. of the nat'l. acad. of sci. 423 (13 january 2004) ("the efficacy of this forcing is »2 (i.e., for a given forcing it is twice as effective as co<sub>2</sub> in altering global surface air temperature)"); ''compare'' zender testimony, ''supra'' note 7, at 4 (figure 3); see j. hansen & l. nazarenko, ''supra'' note 18, at 426.

===human activities===
human activities (e.g., deforestation, farming, and urbanization) change the albedo of various areas around the globe. however, quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult, further study is required to determine anthropogenic effects.<ref>{{cite journal|last=sagan|first=carl|last2=toon|first2=owen b.|last3=pollack|first3=james b.|date=1979|title=anthropogenic albedo changes and the earth's climate|journal=science|volume=206|issue=4425|pages=1363–1368|issn=0036-8075|jstor=1748990|doi=10.1126/science.206.4425.1363|pmid=17739279|bibcode=1979sci...206.1363s}}</ref>

==other types of albedo==
[[single-scattering albedo]] is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles. it depends on properties of the material ([[refractive index]]); the size of the particle or particles; and the wavelength of the incoming radiation.

the earliest certain ancestor of "a" is [[aleph]] (also written 'aleph), the first letter of the [[phoenician alphabet]],<ref name="britannica">{{harvnb|hoiberg|2010|p=1}}</ref> which consisted entirely of [[consonant]]s (for that reason, it is also called an [[abjad]] to distinguish it from a true [[alphabet]]). in turn, the ancestor of aleph may have been a [[pictogram]] of an ox head in [[proto-sinaitic script]]<ref name=coll>{{harvnb|hall-quest|1997|p=1}}</ref> influenced by [[egyptian hieroglyphs]], styled as a triangular head with two horns extended.

by 1600 bc, the phoenician alphabet letter had a linear form that served as the base for some later forms. its name is thought to have corresponded closely to the [[paleo-hebrew alphabet|paleo-hebrew]] or [[arabic script|arabic]] [[aleph]].

when the [[ancient greece|ancient greeks]] adopted the alphabet, they had no use for a letter to represent the [[glottal stop]]—the consonant sound that the letter denoted in [[phoenician language|phoenician]] and other [[semitic languages]], and that was the first [[phoneme]] of the phoenician pronunciation of the letter—so they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel {{ipa|/a/}}, and called it by the similar name of [[alpha]]. in the earliest greek inscriptions after the [[greek dark ages]], dating to the 8th century bc, the letter rests upon its side, but in the [[greek alphabet]] of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter, although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at which the cross line is set.

the [[etruscan civilization|etruscans]] brought the greek alphabet to their civilization in the [[italian peninsula]] and left the letter unchanged. the romans later adopted the [[old italic script|etruscan alphabet]] to write the [[latin|latin language]], and the resulting letter was preserved in the [[latin script|latin alphabet]] that would come to be used to write many languages, including english.

===typographic variants===
[[file:a-small glyphs.svg|thumb|140px|different [[glyphs]] of the lowercase letter a.]]
during roman times, there were many variant forms of the letter "a". first was the monumental or lapidary style, which was used when inscribing on stone or other "permanent" media. there was also a [[cursive]] style used for everyday or utilitarian writing, which was done on more perishable surfaces. due to the "perishable" nature of these surfaces, there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental, but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive, such as [[letter case|majuscule]] cursive, [[letter case|minuscule]] cursive, and semicursive minuscule. variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles. the known variants include the early [[uncial script#half-uncial|semi-uncial]], the uncial, and the later semi-uncial.<ref name=americana>{{harvnb|diringer|2000|p=1}}</ref>

[[file:lowercasea.svg|left|thumb|200px|[[allography|typographic variants]] include a double-storey '''a''' and single-storey '''ɑ'''.]]at the end of the [[roman empire]] (5th century ad), several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through western europe. among these were the semicursive minuscule of [[italy]], the [[merovingian script]] in france, the [[visigothic script]] in spain, and the [[insular script|insular]] or anglo-irish semi-uncial or anglo-saxon majuscule of great britain. by the 9th century, the [[carolingian minuscule|caroline script]], which was very similar to the present-day form, was the principal form used in book-making, before the advent of the printing press. this form was derived through a combining of prior forms.<ref name=americana/>

15th-century italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today. these variants, the ''italic'' and ''roman'' forms, were derived from the caroline script version. the italic form, also called ''script a,'' is used in most current [[handwriting]] and consists of a circle and vertical stroke. this slowly developed from the fifth-century form resembling the greek letter [[tau]] in the hands of medieval irish and english writers.<ref name="britannica"/> the roman form is used in most printed material; it consists of a small loop with an arc over it ("a").<ref name=americana/> both derive from the majuscule (capital) form. in greek handwriting, it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop, as demonstrated by the uncial version shown. many fonts then made the right leg vertical. in some of these, the [[serif]] that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc, resulting in the printed form, while in others it was dropped, resulting in the modern handwritten form.

[[italic type]] is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one part of a text from the rest (set in roman type). there are some other cases aside from italic type where ''script a'' ("ɑ"), also called [[latin alpha]], is used in contrast with latin "a" (such as in the [[international phonetic alphabet]]).

===english===
{{further information|pronunciation of english ⟨a⟩}}
in modern [[english orthography]], the letter {{angbr|a}} represents at least seven different vowel sounds:
*the [[near-open front unrounded vowel]] {{ipa|/æ/}} as in ''pad'';
*the [[open back unrounded vowel]] {{ipa|/ɑː/}} as in ''father'', which is closer to its original latin and greek sound;<ref name=coll/>
*the [[diphthong]] {{ipa|/eɪ/}} as in ''ace'' and ''major'' (usually when {{vr|a}} is followed by one, or occasionally two, consonants and then another vowel letter) – this results from [[middle english lengthening]] followed by the [[great vowel shift]];
*the modified form of the above sound that occurs [[english-language vowel changes before historic /r/|before {{vr|r}}]], as in ''square'' and ''mary'';
*the rounded vowel of ''water'';
*the shorter rounded vowel (not present in [[general american]]) in ''was'' and ''what'';<ref name="britannica"/>
*a [[schwa]], in many unstressed syllables, as in ''about'', ''comma'', ''solar''.

the double {{angbr|aa}} sequence does not occur in native english words, but is found in some words derived from foreign languages such as ''aaron'' and ''[[aardvark]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|gelb|whiting|1998|p=45}}</ref> however, {{vr|a}} occurs in [[list of latin-script digraphs|many common digraphs]], all with their own sound or sounds, particularly {{vr|ai}}, {{vr|au}}, {{vr|aw}}, {{vr|ay}}, {{vr|ea}} and {{vr|oa}}.

{{angbr|a}} is the third-most-commonly used letter in english (after {{angbr|e}} and {{angbr|t}}),<ref>{{harvnb|anon|2004}}</ref> and the second most common in spanish and french. in one study, on average, about 3.68% of letters used in english texts tend to be {{angbr|a}}, while the number is 6.22% in spanish and 3.95% in french.<ref>{{harvnb|anon|2006}}</ref>

===other languages===
in most languages that use the latin alphabet, {{angbr|a}} denotes an open unrounded vowel, such as {{ipa|/[[open front unrounded vowel|a]]/}}, {{ipa|/[[open central unrounded vowel|ä]]/}}, or {{ipa|/[[open back unrounded vowel|ɑ]]/}}. an exception is [[saanich dialect|saanich]], in which {{angbr|a}} (and the glyph [[á]]) stands for a [[close-mid front unrounded vowel]] {{ipa|/e/}}.

===other systems===

in phonetic and phonemic notation:
*in the [[international phonetic alphabet]], {{angbr ipa|a}} is used for the [[open front unrounded vowel]], {{angbr ipa|ä}} is used for the [[open central unrounded vowel]], and {{angbr ipa|ɑ}} is used for the [[open back unrounded vowel]].
*in [[x-sampa]], {{angbr|a}} is used for the [[open front unrounded vowel]] and {{angbr|a}} is used for the [[open back unrounded vowel]].

==other uses==
{{main article|a (disambiguation)}}
in [[algebra]], the letter ''a'' along with other letters at the beginning of the alphabet is used to represent known quantities, whereas the letters at the end of the alphabet (''x'', ''y'', ''z'') are used to denote unknown quantities.

in [[geometry]], capital a, b, c etc. are used to denote [[line segment|segment]]s, [[line (geometry)|line]]s, [[line (geometry)#ray|rays]], etc.<ref name=americana/> a capital a is also typically used as one of the letters to represent an angle in a [[triangle]], the lowercase a representing the side opposite angle a.<ref name=coll/>

"a" is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status: a-, a or a+, the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students' schoolwork; "a grade" for clean restaurants; [[a-list]] celebrities, etc. such associations can have a [[motivation|motivating]] effect, as exposure to the letter a has been found to improve performance, when compared with other letters.<ref>{{harvnb|ciani & sheldon|2010|pp=99–100}}</ref>

"a" is used as a prefix on some words, such as [[asymmetry]], to mean "not" or "without" (from greek).

in english grammar, "a", and its variant "an", is an [[article (grammar)#indefinite article|indefinite article]].

finally, the letter a is used to denote size, as in a narrow size shoe,<ref name=coll/> or a small cup size in a [[brassiere]].<ref>{{cite book|title=the bra book : the fashion formula to finding the perfect bra|last=luciani|first=jené|date=2009|publisher=benbella books, inc|others=voltz, ralph.|isbn=9781933771946|location=dallas, tx|pages=13|oclc=317453115}}</ref>

from the [[american civil war]] until [[world war ii]], alabama, like many states in the [[southern u.s.]], suffered economic hardship, in part because of its continued dependence on [[agriculture]]. similar to other former slave states, alabamian legislators employed [[jim crow laws]] to disenfranchise and otherwise discriminate against [[african americans]] from the end of the [[reconstruction era]] up until at least the 1970s. despite the growth of major industries and urban centers, [[white american|white]] rural interests dominated the state legislature from 1901 to the 1960s. during this time, urban interests and african americans were markedly under-represented. following world war ii, alabama grew as the state's economy changed from one primarily based on agriculture to one with diversified interests. the state's economy in the 21st century is based on management, automotive, finance, manufacturing, aerospace, mineral extraction, healthcare, education, retail, and technology.<ref name="alaindustrial">{{cite web |url=http://www2.dir.alabama.gov/projections/occupational/proj2018/statewide/alabama2008_2018.pdf |title=alabama occupational projections 2008–2018 |website=alabama department of industrial relations |publisher=state of alabama |accessdate=september 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117053325/http://www2.dir.alabama.gov/projections/occupational/proj2018/statewide/alabama2008_2018.pdf |archivedate=january 17, 2013}}</ref>

as part of settlement of this case, five alabama cities and counties, including [[chilton county, alabama|chilton county]], adopted a system of [[proportional representation|cumulative voting]] for election of representatives in multi-seat jurisdictions. this has resulted in more proportional representation for voters. in another form of proportional representation, 23 jurisdictions use limited voting, as in [[conecuh county, alabama|conecuh county]]. in 1982, limited voting was first tested in [[conecuh county, alabama|conecuh county]]. together use of these systems has increased the number of african americans and women being elected to local offices, resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens.<ref name="cum">[http://archive.fairvote.org/?page=516 "cumulative elections in alabama (2004)"/"proportional voting in alabama"], fairvote archives, accessed january 11, 2015</ref>

the peak season for tornadoes varies from the northern to southern parts of the state. alabama is one of the few places in the world that has a secondary tornado season in november and december besides the typically severe spring. the northern part—along the tennessee river valley—is most vulnerable. the area of alabama and mississippi most affected by tornadoes is sometimes referred to as [[dixie alley]], as distinct from the [[tornado alley]] of the southern plains.

winters are generally mild in alabama, as they are throughout most of the [[southeastern united states]], with average january low temperatures around {{convert|40|°f}} in mobile and around {{convert|32|°f}} in birmingham. although snow is a rare event in much of alabama, areas of the state north of montgomery may receive a dusting of snow a few times every winter, with an occasional moderately heavy snowfall every few years. historic snowfall events include [[new year's eve 1963 snowstorm]] and the [[1993 storm of the century]]. the annual average snowfall for the birmingham area is {{convert|2|in|mm}} per year. in the southern gulf coast, snowfall is less frequent, sometimes going several years without any snowfall.

the foundational document for alabama's government is the [[alabama constitution]], which was ratified in 1901. at almost 800 amendments and 310,000 words, it is by some accounts the world's longest constitution and is roughly forty times the length of the [[united states constitution]].<ref>tim lockette, [http://www.annistonstar.com/article_c928bd51-fbf1-5056-a30c-1bf4b19eb012.html?mode=jqm is the alabama constitution the longest constitution in the world?truth rating: 4 out of 5], ''anniston star''.</ref><ref>campbell robertson, [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/31/us/alabama-simmers-before-vote-on-its-constitutions-racist-language.html alabama simmers before vote on its constitution's racist language], ''new york times'', october 10, 2012.</ref><ref name="washington post">{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/a16443-2004nov27 |last=roig-franzia |first=manuel |title=alabama vote opens old racial wounds |work=the washington post |date=november 28, 2004 |accessdate=september 22, 2006}}</ref><ref name="constitution">{{cite web |url=http://www.legislature.state.al.us/codeofalabama/constitution/1901/constitution1901_toc.htm |title=constitution of alabama—1901 |website=the alabama legislative information system |accessdate=september 22, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923081542/http://www.legislature.state.al.us/codeofalabama/constitution/1901/constitution1901_toc.htm |archivedate=september 23, 2006 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

there has been a significant movement to rewrite and modernize alabama's constitution.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.constitutionalreform.org/ |title=alabama citizens for constitutional reform |publisher=constitutionalreform.org |accessdate=october 24, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100915165938/http://www.constitutionalreform.org/ |archivedate=september 15, 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref> critics argue that alabama's constitution maintains highly centralized power with the state legislature, leaving practically no power in local hands. most counties do not have home rule. any policy changes proposed in different areas of the state must be approved by the entire alabama legislature and, frequently, by state referendum. one criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism.
[[file:ala supreme court building feb 2012 01.jpg|thumb|the [[alabama judicial building|heflin-torbert judicial building]] in montgomery. it houses the [[supreme court of alabama]], [[alabama court of civil appeals]], and [[alabama court of criminal appeals]].]]

alabama's government is divided into three coequal branches. the [[legislative branch]] is the [[alabama legislature]], a [[bicameral]] assembly composed of the [[alabama house of representatives]], with 105 members, and the [[alabama senate]], with 35 members. the legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation. the [[republican party (united states)|republican party]] currently holds a majority in both houses of the [[alabama legislature|legislature]]. the legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority (most state legislatures require a two-thirds majority to override a veto).

until 1964, the state elected state senators on a geographic basis by county, with one per county. it had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in 1901; as a result, urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented. it had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses, either. in ''[[reynolds v. sims]]'' (1964), the u.s. supreme court implemented the principle of "[[one man, one vote]]", ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses (as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented.) further, the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population, as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems.

at that time, alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting, as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts. this had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas. for instance, birmingham and jefferson county taxes had supplied one-third of the state budget, but jefferson county received only 1/67th of state services in funding. through the legislative delegations, the alabama legislature kept control of county governments.
[[file:portrait-governor-kay-ivey.jpg|thumb|upright|[[republican party (united states)|republican]] [[kay ivey]] is the current [[governor of alabama]].]]

the members of the legislature take office immediately after the november elections. statewide officials, such as the governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, and other constitutional officers, take office the following january.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legislature.state.al.us/misc/legislativeprocess/legislativeprocess_ml.html |title=alabama's legislative process |first=mcdowell |last=lee |year=2009 |publisher=state of alabama |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102162559/http://www.legislature.state.al.us/misc/legislativeprocess/legislativeprocess_ml.html |archivedate=january 2, 2011}}</ref>

===county and local governments===
{{see also|list of counties in alabama}}
{{alabama county labelled map|align=right|width=300}}

alabama has 67 [[county (united states)|counties]]. each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually called the county commission. it also has limited executive authority in the county. because of the constraints of the [[alabama constitution]], which centralizes power in the state legislature, only seven counties (jefferson, lee, mobile, madison, montgomery, shelby, and tuscaloosa) in the state have limited [[home rule]]. instead, most counties in the state must lobby the local legislation committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved, ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning.

the state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing [[home rule]] for counties, as recommended by the 1973 alabama constitutional commission.<ref name="home"/> legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county. united states supreme court decisions in ''[[baker v. carr]]'' (1964) required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population, and redistricted after each census, in order to implement the principle of "one man, one vote". before that, each county was represented by one state senator, leading to under-representation in the state senate for more urbanized, populous counties. the rural bias of the state legislature, which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house, affected politics well into the 20th century, failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas.

"the lack of home rule for counties in alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution. alabama's constitution has been amended more than 700 times, and almost one-third of the amendments are local in nature, applying to only one county or city. a significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation, taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance."<ref name="home">[http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1153#sthash.cmemrnbk.dpuf albert p. brewer, "home rule"], ''encyclopedia of alabama'', 2007, accessed february 3, 2015</ref>

alabama is an [[alcoholic beverage control state]], meaning the state government holds a monopoly on the sale of alcohol. the [[alabama alcoholic beverage control board]] controls the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages in the state. twenty-five of the 67 counties are "[[dry county|dry counties]]" which ban the sale of alcohol, and there are many dry municipalities even in counties which permit alcohol sales.<ref>[http://abcboard.alabama.gov/%28s%28s1j4zjl5nddpfshvrhppmpsb%29%29/wet_dry_map.aspx wet-dry map] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009231316/http://abcboard.alabama.gov/(s(s1j4zjl5nddpfshvrhppmpsb))/wet_dry_map.aspx |date=october 9, 2016}}, alabama alcoholic beverage control board.</ref>

===politics===
during [[reconstruction era|reconstruction]] following the [[american civil war]], alabama was occupied by federal troops of the [[third military district]] under [[john pope (military officer)|general john pope]]. in 1874, the political coalition of white democrats known as the [[redeemers]] took control of the state government from the republicans, in part by suppressing the black vote through violence, fraud and intimidation.

after 1890, a coalition of white democratic politicians passed laws to [[racial segregation|segregate]] and disenfranchise african american residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. provisions which disenfranchised blacks resulted in excluding many poor whites. by 1941 more whites than blacks had been disenfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000. the total effects were greater on the black community, as almost all its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law.

from 1901 through the 1960s, the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas. as counties were the basis of election districts, the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three-quarters of the century, until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in 1972 to meet equal representation.

alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the [[civil rights movement]], when whites bureaucratically, and at times violently, resisted protests for electoral and social reform. governor [[george wallace]], the state's only four-term governor, was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation. only after passage of the federal [[civil rights act of 1964]]<ref name="cra64"/> and [[voting rights act of 1965]] did african americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage, among other civil rights. in many jurisdictions, they continued to be excluded from representation by [[at-large]] electoral systems, which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections. some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish [[single-member districts]] that enable a more diverse representation among county boards.

in 2007, the [[alabama legislature]] passed, and republican governor [[bob riley]] signed a resolution expressing "profound regret" over slavery and its lingering impact. in a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the [[alabama state capitol]], which housed congress of the [[confederate states of america]].<ref>{{cite news |first=phillip |last=rawls |title=alabama offers an apology for slavery |work=the virginian pilot |publisher=landmark communications |date=june 1, 2007}}</ref>

in 2010, republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2010/11/gop_takes_alabama_legislature.html |title=gop takes control of alabama legislature after 136 years |last=white |first=david|date=november 2, 2010|work=[[the birmingham news]] |accessdate=july 9, 2018}}</ref>

{{as of|2017|december|}}, there are a total of 3,326,812 registered voters, with 2,979,576 active, and the others inactive in the state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sos.alabama.gov/alabama-votes/voter/election-data |title=elections data downloads |publisher=alabama secretary of state |accessdate=december 12, 2017}}</ref>

[[file:doug jones biden event.jpg|thumb|senator [[doug jones (politician)|doug jones]] won a [[2017 united states senate special election in alabama|special election]] in 2017.]]

====state elections====
with the [[disfranchisement after reconstruction era|disfranchisement of blacks]] in 1901, the state became part of the "[[solid south]]", a system in which the [[democratic party (united states)|democratic party]] operated as effectively the only viable political party in every southern state. for nearly a hundred years local and state elections in alabama were decided in the democratic party [[primary election|primary]], with generally only token [[republican party (united states)|republican]] challengers running in the general election. since the mid- to late 20th century, however, white conservatives started shifting to the republican party. in alabama, majority-white districts are now expected to regularly elect republican candidates to federal, state and local office.

members of the nine seats on the [[supreme court of alabama]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2009/05/sue_bell_cobb_considering_runn.html |title=sue bell cobb considering running for governor |website=the birmingham news |date=may 2, 2009 |accessdate=august 7, 2009}}</ref> and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office. until 1994, no republicans held any of the court seats. in that general election, the then-incumbent chief justice, [[ernest c. hornsby]], refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3,000 votes to republican [[perry o. hooper, sr.]]. hornsby sued alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court. this ultimately led to a collapse of support for democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles. the democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in august 2011 with the resignation of the last democrat on the bench.

in the early 21st century, republicans hold all seven of the [[political party strength in alabama|statewide elected executive]] branch offices. republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the [[alabama state board of education]]. in 2010, republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature, giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years. the last remaining statewide democrat, who served on the alabama public service commission was defeated in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.psc.state.al.us/commissioners.htm |title=commissioners |publisher=psc.state.al.us |accessdate=august 7, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718210525/http://www.psc.state.al.us/commissioners.htm |archivedate=july 18, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=special |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2008/11/lucy_baxley_wins_alabama_publi.html |title=lucy baxley wins alabama public service commission presidency, but recount possible |publisher=birmingham news via al.com |date=november 5, 2008 |accessdate=august 7, 2009 |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090802212747/http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2008/11/lucy_baxley_wins_alabama_publi.html |archivedate=august 2, 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=jeff amy |url=http://blog.al.com/live/2010/11/public_service_commission.html |title=public service commission: twinkle cavanaugh, terry dunn join gop sweep |publisher=al.com |accessdate=june 1, 2011 |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120306232802/http://blog.al.com/live/2010/11/public_service_commission.html |archivedate=march 6, 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

only three republican lieutenant governors have been elected since the end of reconstruction, when republicans generally represented reconstruction government, including the newly emancipated [[freedman|freedmen]] who had gained the franchise. the three gop lieutenant governors are [[steve windom]] (1999–2003), [[kay ivey]] (2011–2017), and [[will ainsworth]] (2019–present).

====local elections====
many local offices (county commissioners, boards of education, tax assessors, tax collectors, etc.) in the state are still held by democrats. many rural counties have voters who are majority democrats, resulting in local elections being decided in the democratic primary. similarly many metropolitan and suburban counties are majority-republican and elections are effectively decided in the republican primary, although there are exceptions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://uselectionatlas.org/results/state.php?fips=1&year=2006&f=0&off=5&elect=1 |title=2006 gubernatorial democratic primary election results—alabama |publisher=uselectionatlas.org |accessdate=august 7, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://uselectionatlas.org/results/state.php?fips=1&year=2006&f=0&off=5&elect=2 |title=2006 gubernatorial republican primary election results—alabama |publisher=uselectionatlas.org |date=february 15, 2007 |accessdate=august 7, 2009}}</ref>

alabama's 67 county sheriffs are elected in partisan, [[at-large]] races, and democrats still retain the narrow majority of those posts. the current split is 35 [[alabama democratic party|democrats]], 31 [[alabama republican party|republicans]], and one independent fayette.<ref name="asa">{{cite web |url=http://www.alabamasheriffs.com/pages?id=41 |title=alabama sheriffs 2015–2019 |website=www.alabamasheriffs.com}}</ref> however, most of the democratic sheriffs preside over rural and less populated counties. the majority of republican sheriffs have been elected in the more urban/suburban and heavily populated counties. {{as of|2015}}, the state of alabama has one female sheriff, in [[morgan county, alabama]], and ten african-american sheriffs.<ref name="asa"/>

====federal elections====
the state's two [[united states senate|u.s. senators]] are republican [[richard shelby|richard c. shelby]] and democrat [[doug jones (politician)|doug jones]]. shelby was originally elected to the senate as a democrat in 1986 and re-elected in 1992, but switched parties immediately following the november 1994 general election.

in the [[united states house of representatives|u.s. house of representatives]], the state is represented by seven members, six of whom are republicans: ([[bradley byrne]], [[mike d. rogers]], [[robert aderholt]], [[morris j. brooks]], [[martha roby]], and [[gary palmer (politician)|gary palmer]]) and one democrat: [[terri sewell]] who represents the [[black belt (region of alabama)|black belt]] as well as most of the predominantly black portions of [[birmingham, alabama|birmingham]], [[tuscaloosa, alabama|tuscaloosa]] and [[montgomery, alabama|montgomery]].

===primary and secondary education===

public primary and secondary education in alabama is under the purview of the [[alabama state board of education]] as well as local oversight by 67 county school boards and 60 city boards of education. together, 1,496 individual schools provide education for 744,637 elementary and secondary students.<ref name="qfacts">{{cite web |url= http://www.alsde.edu/sec/comm/pages/quickfacts-item.aspx?filterfield1=id&filtervalue1=7 |title= alabama education quick facts 2012–13 |accessdate =april 29, 2014 |format= pdf}}</ref>

public school funding is appropriated through the alabama legislature through the education trust fund. in fy 2006–2007, alabama appropriated $3,775,163,578 for primary and secondary education. that represented an increase of $444,736,387 over the previous fiscal year. in 2007, more than 82 percent of schools made adequate yearly progress (ayp) toward student proficiency under the national [[no child left behind]] law, using measures determined by the state of alabama.

while alabama's public education system has improved in recent decades, it lags behind in achievement compared to other states. according to u.s. census data (2000), alabama's high school graduation rate (75%) is the fourth lowest in the u.s. (after [[kentucky]], [[louisiana]] and [[mississippi]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/c2kbr-24.pdf |title=educational attainment : 2000 : census 2000 brief |website=census.gov |accessdate=december 29, 2016}}</ref> the largest educational gains were among people with some college education but without degrees.<ref>[http://www.censusscope.org/us/s1/chart_education.html education statistics]. censusscope.org</ref>

===aviation===
{{main|aviation in alabama}}

major airports with sustained operations in alabama include [[birmingham-shuttlesworth international airport]] (bhm), [[huntsville international airport]] (hsv), [[dothan regional airport]] (dhn), [[mobile regional airport]] (mob), [[montgomery regional airport]] (mgm), [[northwest alabama regional airport]]<!--no longer muscle shoals aux--> (msl) and [[northeast alabama regional airport]] (gad).

===rail===
for rail transport, [[amtrak]] schedules the ''[[crescent (train)|crescent]]'', a daily passenger train, running from new york to new orleans with station stops at [[anniston station|anniston]], [[birmingham station (alabama)|birmingham]], and [[tuscaloosa station|tuscaloosa]].

===roads===
alabama has six major interstate routes: [[interstate 65 in alabama|interstate 65]] (i-65) travels north–south roughly through the middle of the state; [[interstate 20 in alabama|i-20]]/[[interstate 59 in alabama|i-59]] travel from the central west mississippi state line to birmingham, where i-59 continues to the north-east corner of the state and i-20 continues east towards [[atlanta, georgia|atlanta]]; [[interstate 85 in alabama|i-85]] originates in montgomery and travels east-northeast to the georgia state line, providing a main thoroughfare to atlanta; and [[interstate 10 in alabama|i-10]] traverses the southernmost portion of the state, traveling from west to east through mobile. [[interstate 22 in alabama|i-22]] enters the state from [[mississippi]] and connects birmingham with [[memphis, tennessee]]. in addition, there are currently five auxiliary interstate routes in the state: [[interstate 165 (alabama)|i-165]] in mobile, [[interstate 359|i-359]] in tuscaloosa, [[interstate 459|i-459]] around birmingham, [[interstate 565|i-565]] in decatur and huntsville, and [[interstate 759|i-759]] in gadsden. a sixth route, [[interstate 685|i-685]], will be formed when i-85 is rerouted along a new southern bypass of montgomery. a proposed northern bypass of birmingham will be designated as [[interstate 422|i-422]]. since a direct connection from i-22 to i-422 will not be possible, [[interstate 222|i-222]] has been proposed, as well.

several u.s. highways also pass through the state, such as [[u.s. route 11 in alabama|u.s. route 11]] (us-11), [[u.s. route 29 in alabama|us-29]], [[u.s. route 31 in alabama|us-31]], [[u.s. route 43 in alabama|us-43]], [[u.s. route 45 in alabama|us-45]], [[u.s. route 72 in alabama|us-72]], [[u.s. route 78 in alabama|us-78]], [[u.s. route 80 in alabama|us-80]], [[u.s. route 82 in alabama|us-82]], [[u.s. route 84 in alabama|us-84]], [[u.s. route 90 in alabama|us-90]], [[u.s. route 98 in alabama|us-98]], [[u.s. route 231 in alabama|us-231]], [[u.s. route 278 in alabama|us-278]], [[u.s. route 280 in alabama|us-280]], [[u.s. route 331 in alabama|us-331]], [[u.s. route 411 in alabama|us-411]], and [[u.s. route 431 in alabama|us-431]].

there are four toll roads in the state: montgomery expressway in [[montgomery, alabama|montgomery]]; northport/tuscaloosa western bypass in [[tuscaloosa, alabama|tuscaloosa]] and [[northport, alabama|northport]]; emerald mountain expressway in [[wetumpka, alabama|wetumpka]]; and beach express in [[orange beach, alabama|orange beach]].

===ports===
the [[port of mobile]], alabama's only saltwater port, is a large seaport on the [[gulf of mexico]] with inland waterway access to the [[midwestern united states|midwest]] by way of the [[tennessee-tombigbee waterway]]. the port of mobile was ranked 12th by tons of traffic in the united states during 2009.<ref name="tonstraffic">{{cite web |title=table 1086. top u.s. ports by tons of traffic: 2009 |website=u.s. army corps of engineers |url=https://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2012/tables/12s1087.pdf |accessdate=july 22, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019042444/http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2012/tables/12s1087.pdf |archive-date=october 19, 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> the newly expanded [[container terminal]] at the port of mobile was ranked as the 25th busiest for container traffic in the nation during 2011.<ref name="containers">{{cite web |title=u.s. waterborne container traffic by port/waterway in 2011 (loaded and empty teus) |website=u.s. army corps of engineers |url=http://www.navigationdatacenter.us/wcsc/by_porttons11.html |accessdate=july 22, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103145509/http://www.navigationdatacenter.us/wcsc/by_porttons11.html|archive-date=november 3, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> the state's other ports are on rivers with access to the gulf of mexico.
